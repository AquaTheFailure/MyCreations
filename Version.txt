Skribbl Project Versioning Guide
===============================

This guide explains how to properly version your Skribbl HTML/JS projects and name your files for easy tracking and clarity.

---

Versioning Scheme
----------------

We use Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

V<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>

1. MAJOR
---------
- When to increment:
  - Big changes that break compatibility with previous versions.
  - Complete UI redesigns or structural changes (e.g., switching from 2 iframes to 1 iframe).
- Examples:
  - V2.0.0 → Redesigned UI completely.
  - V3.0.0 → Added a completely new system, like multiple game support.

2. MINOR
---------
- When to increment:
  - Adding new features without breaking existing functionality.
  - Examples:
    - "Join room with code or link"
    - "Hideable UI"
    - "Notifications for iframe load"
- Examples:
  - V1.1.0 → Added the room join feature.
  - V1.2.0 → Added iframe toggle between hints and main game.

3. PATCH
---------
- When to increment:
  - Bug fixes or small tweaks.
  - Cosmetic changes (colors, layout tweaks, small optimizations).
- Examples:
  - V1.1.1 → Fixed the input clearing after joining a room.
  - V1.1.2 → Adjusted iframe size to fit screen properly.

---

File Naming Guidelines
---------------------

- Keep the version in the filename for clarity:

  V1.0.0.html          → Initial release
  V1.1.0-RoomJoin.html → Added room join feature
  V1.1.1-FixInput.html → Fixed input clearing bug

- Include a short description if the update is significant.
- Keep older versions if you want to maintain a history of changes.

---

Quick Rules of Thumb
-------------------

1. Big redesign → Increment MAJOR, reset MINOR & PATCH to 0.
2. Add feature → Increment MINOR, reset PATCH to 0.
3. Fix bug / small tweak → Increment PATCH only.
4. Keep previous versions for reference.

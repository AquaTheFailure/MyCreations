# Versioning Scheme

We use Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

V<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>

---

## 1. MAJOR

When to increment:

 Big changes that break compatibility with previous versions.
 Complete redesigns or structural changes to the project.

Examples:

 V2.0.0 → Complete UI redesign.
 V3.0.0 → Added a completely new system or feature set.

---

## 2. MINOR

When to increment:

 Adding new features without breaking existing functionality.
 Enhancements that improve user experience or functionality.

Examples:

 V1.1.0 → Added a new feature like a room join option or settings panel.
 V1.2.0 → Added toggle options, notifications, or other features.

---

## 3. PATCH

When to increment:

 Bug fixes or small tweaks.
 Cosmetic changes (colors, layout tweaks, optimizations).

Examples:

 V1.1.1 → Fixed input clearing issue.
 V1.1.2 → Adjusted layout for better responsiveness.

# File Naming Guidelines

 Keep the version in the filename for clarity:

V1.0.0.html            → Initial release
V1.1.0-NewFeature.html → Added a new feature
V1.1.1-FixBug.html     → Fixed a bug or small issue

 Include a short description if the update is significant.
 Keep older versions for history and reference.

# Quick Rules of Thumb

1. Big redesign → Increment MAJOR, reset MINOR & PATCH to 0.
2. Add feature → Increment MINOR, reset PATCH to 0.
3. Fix bug / small tweak → Increment PATCH only.
4. Keep previous versions for reference and documentation.
